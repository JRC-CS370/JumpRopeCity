Jump-Rope-City
==============

Jump Rope City was a semester long project completed for the CS370 Software Engineering class at SUNY Polytechnic Institute. 

## Goals:

Our goal for this project was simple, to create a graphical game that players could play by writing assembly code. This program would integrate with the MiniAT system, MiniAT is an open-source embedded microcontroller packaged as an easy to use C library.

## Development:

Development took place over a 16 week semester at SUNY Polytechnic Institute, this repository is here to show what was accomplished within this time frame. If you would like to see more this project was forked and development is being continued at the repository linked below.
